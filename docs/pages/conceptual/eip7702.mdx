# EIP-7702

EIP-7702 is a proposal set for inclusion in the upcoming 2025 Pectra hardfork. The proposal introduces a new transaction type that allows EOA's to assign a "delegation designator" to their account. The delegation designator points to a smart contract and when a transaction is sent to the EOA, it executes the code at the designated address.

This unlocks huge benefits for EOAs, as they can now access smart account features such as batching transactions, gas sponsorships, passkeys as signers, and more.

A full demo showing how to use ERC-4337 with EIP-7702 can be found [here](/permissionless/how-to/eip-7702-demo).

## FAQ

### What are the limitations of wallet implementations for EIP-7702?

Most wallets restrict the EIP-7702 upgrade feature to:
- Their own implementation
- A very limited set of smart account implementations

Wallets typically do not allow users to choose custom code to upgrade to. This means you have two options when implementing EIP-7702:

1. Have the user provide their private key (this is a significant security risk and not recommended)
2. Prompt the user to upgrade their EOA wallet (e.g., Metamask) to the respective 7702 implementation that the wallet allows, and use the features available through that implementation
