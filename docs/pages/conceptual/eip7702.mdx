# EIP-7702

EIP-7702 is a proposal set for inclusion in the upcoming 2025 Pectra hardfork. The proposal introduces a new transaction type that allows EOA's to assign a "delegation designator" to their account. The delegation designator points to a smart contract and when a transaction is sent to the EOA, it executes the code at the designated address.

This unlocks huge benefits for EOAs, as they can now access smart account features such as batching transactions, gas sponsorships, passkeys as signers, and more. This guide showcases a simple demo that uses ERC-4337 and EIP-7702 to send a userOperation from a EOA.

## Steps

::::steps

### Setup

This demo will be ran on the [Odyssey Testnet](https://www.ithaca.xyz/updates/odyssey), which already implements EIP-7702.

To get started, you can bridge funds from Sepolia to Odyssey through [Conduit's SuperBridge](https://odyssey-fba0638ec5f46615.testnets.rollbridge.app/).

You can confirm the bridge transfer by checking the [Odyssey blockchain explorer](https://odyssey-explorer.ithaca.xyz/).

### Confirming the EOA has no code

Before starting the demo, we can quickly confirm that our EOA has no code attached to it by running the following command:

```bash
cast code $YOUR_EOA_ADDRESS --rpc-url https://odyssey.ithaca.xyz
```

If should return back the following:

```
0x
```

### Signing the Delegation Designation Transaction

Before we start sending UserOperations from our EOA, we first have to sign a authorization request to set our designated designator. This demo uses Safe as our smart account implementation, but you can use any ERC-4337 compatible smart account.

it by sending the delegation designation tx. Not only this, but we also have to initialize/populate the EOA's storage so that the smart account implementation has context.
