The MagicSpend++ protocol solves the problem of having a fragmented balances across multiple chains. It allows users to spend their assets on any chain without having to worry about bridging.

## Abstract

MagicSpend++ allows users to request funds on any chain they need, by sending a single withdraw request to a MagicSpend++ contract. This call contains all the details about recipient, amount, asset, etc as long as the valid signature. Any user can request a withdrawal signature, in exchange for a portion of the user's balance.
