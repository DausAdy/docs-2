## How It Works

1. **Top Up Your Balance**: Add funds to your Pimlico account using a credit card or bank transfer through the [dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/billing/payment-methods)
2. **Request Withdrawals**: Use these funds to request signed withdrawal messages for any supported token on any supported chain
3. **Execute Transactions**: Submit the signed messages to receive tokens directly on your target chain

This means you can:
- Fund transactions on any supported chain without bridging assets
- Pay for gas fees in any supported token
- Execute cross-chain operations without managing multiple token balances
- Handle all blockchain interactions while keeping a single fiat-denominated balance

## Features

- Multi-chain support
- Gasless transactions
- Smart account integration
- Pre and post-call hooks for complex operations
- Simple fiat on-ramp through credit card or bank transfer
