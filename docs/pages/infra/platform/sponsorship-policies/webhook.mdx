# How to use Sponsorship Policy webhook

Webhook allows you to receive real-time notifications when a sponsorship policy is triggered. You can use webhooks to approve or reject sponsoring userops. Start by going to the [sponsorship policies page](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/sponsorship-policies) on the Pimlico dashboard, clicking on the existing policy and clicking on the "Edit button".

Request is sent with POST, where body is a JSON object with the following structure:

```typescript
const body = {
    type: 'sponsorshipPolicy.webhook',
    data: {
        object: {
            userOperation,
            entryPoint,
            chainId,
            sponsorshipPolicyId: sponsorshipPolicy.id    
        }
    }
};
```

The returned value should be a JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
    "sponsor": true // Boolean
}
```

## How to verify the webhook

To verify the webhook, you can use the `@pimlico/webhook` package. You will need to provide the webhook secret, which you can find in the sponsorship policy [settings](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/sponsorship-policies).

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install @pimlico/webhook
```

### Usage

```typescript
import { pimlicoWebhookVerifier } from "@pimlico/webhook"
import type { VercelRequest, VercelResponse } from "@vercel/node"

const webhookSecret = process.env.PIMLICO_WEBHOOK_SECRET as string

const verifyWebhook = pimlicoWebhookVerifier(webhookSecret)

export default async function handler(req: VercelRequest, res: VercelResponse) {
    const webhookEvent = verifyWebhook(
        req.headers as Record<string, string>,
        JSON.stringify(req.body)
    )

    // console.log(webhookEvent.data.object.userOperation)

    return res.status(200).json({
        sponsor: true
    })
}
```
