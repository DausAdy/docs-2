# Pimlico Paymasters

Pimlico providers two different types of paymasters to allow you to abstract away the gas fees for your users.

## Verifying Paymaster

Our Verifying Paymaster allows you to load up your off-chain Pimlico balance through [our dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io) and sponsor the on-chain gas fees for your users on over 100+ chains.

## ERC-20 Paymaster

Our ERC-20 Paymaster is a permissionless on-chain smart contract that lets your users pay for their own gas fees using their ERC-20 tokens.
