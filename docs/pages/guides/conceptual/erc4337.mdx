# ERC-4337

ERC-4337 is the leading proposal to achieve account abstraction on EVM chains. The standard works by creating a new type of transaction, called user operartion, that special relayers called bundlers can submit through a so-called EntryPoint contract that is able to prompt smart accounts compatible with the ERC-4337 interface to check whether the smart account considers the user operation to be valid, and then execute said user operation.
