# Getting Started with Pimlico

Welcome to Pimlico, the world's most advanced ERC-4337 account abstraction infrastructure platform. This guide will help you understand Pimlico's ecosystem and get you started with building applications using our tools and services.

## What is Pimlico?

Pimlico provides a suite of tools and services to help you build, deploy, and manage smart accounts on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. Our infrastructure powers the next generation of web3 applications by making account abstraction accessible and easy to implement.

## Core Products

Pimlico offers several key products that work together to provide a complete account abstraction solution:

### permissionless.js

A TypeScript library built on viem for interacting with ERC-4337 bundlers, paymasters, and user operations. It provides:

- High-level smart account support for popular implementations (Safe, Kernel, Biconomy, TrustWallet, etc.)
- Bundler support for all ERC-4337 actions
- Gas sponsorship capabilities
- User Operation utility functions
- Modular and extensible architecture

### Bundler

Our Alto Bundler is a performant, type-safe ERC-4337 bundler written in TypeScript that powers smart accounts by relaying user operations for fast and reliable on-chain inclusion. Key features include:

- Full type safety
- Transaction inclusion reliability
- Fast transaction inclusion speed
- Support for 100+ EVM chains

### Paymasters

Pimlico offers two types of paymasters to abstract away gas fees for your users:

1. **Verifying Paymaster**: Load up your off-chain Pimlico balance through our dashboard and sponsor on-chain gas fees for your users across 100+ chains.

2. **ERC-20 Paymaster**: A permissionless on-chain smart contract that lets your users pay for their own gas fees using ERC-20 tokens.

### Batua

A fully customizable smart account UI component built with shadcn/ui and secured with passkeys. Batua makes it easy to add account abstraction to your application with a beautiful, ready-to-use interface.
