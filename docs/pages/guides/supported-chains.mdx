# Supported Chains

All API calls must use the JSON-RPC format and be sent to the following URL:

```
https://api.pimlico.io/v2/target_chain/rpc?apikey=your_api_key_here
```

Where chain is either the chainId or chain name.

For example to access Base, both of these endpoints will work:
- https://api.pimlico.io/v2/8453/rpc?apikey=your_api_key_here
- https://api.pimlico.io/v2/base/rpc?apikey=your_api_key_here

# Pimlico supports the following chains:

import SupportedChains from "../../../data/supported-chains.md"
import ChainDetails from "../../../data/chain-details.md";

<SupportedChains />

## Chain Details

Below you can find detailed information about supported entrypoints and account implementations for each chain. For each chain, the table shows which account implementations support which entrypoint versions.
