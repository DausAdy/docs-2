# ERC-4337 vs EIP-7702

This page outlines the key differences and design motivations behind ERC-4337 and EIP-7702 — two distinct approaches to improving smart accounts (also known as "account abstraction") on Ethereum.

## TL;DR

- **ERC-4337**: Defines a standard interface for smart accounts that allows them to plug into standard relayers (bundlers) and paymasters such as Pimlico. No protocol upgrades required.
- **EIP-7702**: Allows EOAs to become smart accounts. Requires a protocol upgrade.

Importantly, **ERC-4337 and EIP-7702 are not competing proposals**. You can use both together, allowing EOAs to become smart accounts while also plugging into standard relayers and paymasters.

Given that ERC-4337 is already live and has a large ecosystem, it is the de-facto standard for smart account relaying and gas sponsoring today and is expected to be the main way that most smart accounts with EIP-7702 will also be used.

## ERC-4337 Overview

- **Timeline**: Proposal finalized in March 2023, latest EntryPoint contract deployed in April 2025.
- **Requires a Protocol Upgrade**: No
- **Mechanism**: Standardizes the bundler and paymaster interface, introduces an `EntryPoint` contract to handle smart account transaction flows.
- **Key Concepts**: User Operations, bundlers, paymasters

### Pros
- No hard fork needed
- Modular and extensible design (plug-in paymasters, validation logic, etc.)
- Ecosystem already building on it (e.g., Pimlico, Safe, Stackup)

### Cons
- Complex architecture (bundlers, extra calldata)

## EIP-7702 Overview

- **Timeline**: Expected to be included in the Pectra hardfork, on May 7, 2025.
- **Requires a Protocol Upgrade**: Yes
- **Mechanism**: Turns an EOA into a contract account during via a new transaction type.
- **Key Concepts**: `authorization_list`

### Pros
- Clean UX: complexity is in the protocol
- Reuses existing transaction flow (no separate mempool or entry point)

### Cons
- Requires hard fork and client changes
- Not all chains will have it live at the same time — backwards compatibility will be required.
- Master EOA retains ability to control and change the code of the smart account, true multisig / social recovery is not possible
