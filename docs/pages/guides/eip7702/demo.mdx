# Send a user operation from an EOA

This guide showcases a simple demo that uses ERC-4337 and EIP-7702 to send a sponsored user operation from a EOA. We will use SimpleSmartAccount as our smart account implementation of choice, other ERC-7702 compatible smart accounts will work as well.

For a high level overview of EIP-7702, checkout our [EIP-7702 conceptual guide](/guides/eip7702) and for a more technical overview, please refer to the [EIP-7702 proposal](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702).

## Installation

Make sure you have `viem^2.28.0` and `permissionless^0.2.24` installed.

```bash
npm install permissionless viem
```

### Steps

::::steps

### Setup the smart account

The setup process follows the typical flow of sending a userOperation. The only difference is that when creating the Simple smart account instance, we set the sender address as our EOA's address.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/embeddedSendTransaction.ts:createSmartAccount]
```

### Setup paymaster (optional)

The paymaster client will be responsible for interacting with Pimlico's verifying paymaster endpoint and requesting sponsorship. Make sure to replace YOUR_PIMLICO_API_KEY in the code below with your actual Pimlico API key.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/embeddedSendTransaction.ts:setupPaymaster]
```


### Create Smart Account Client

A Smart Account Client is an almost drop-in replacement for a standard viem walletClient but for managing smart accounts instead of EOA accounts. In addition, a Smart Account Client also contains, depending on the underlying smart account implementation used, a few extra actions that are specific to smart accounts.

To create a Smart Account Client, use the createSmartAccountClient function.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/embeddedSendTransaction.ts:createSmartAccountClient]
```


### Sending the transaction

Make sure you set the signed authorization for the first time when the EOA does not have the authorization code set.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/embeddedSendTransaction.ts:sendTransaction]
```


### Batch multiple transactions

The process is the same as sending a single transaction, the only difference is that we pass an array of calls to the sendTransaction function.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/embeddedSendTransaction.ts:sendTransactions]
```


### Review

Congratulations! You have successfully sent a sponsored userOperation from your EOA, if you review the transaction on the blockchain explorer, you will see that the userOperation's sender address is equal to your EOA's address.
