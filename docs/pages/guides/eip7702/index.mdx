# EIP-7702

EIP-7702 is a proposal set for inclusion in the upcoming 2025 Pectra hardfork. The proposal introduces a new transaction type that allows EOA's to assign a "delegation designator" to their account. The delegation designator points to a smart contract and when a transaction is sent to the EOA, it executes the code at the designated address.

This unlocks huge benefits for EOAs, as they can now access smart account features such as batching transactions, gas sponsorships, passkeys as signers, and more.

A full demo showing how to use ERC-4337 with EIP-7702 can be found [here](/guides/eip7702/demo).

## FAQ

### Will I be able to upgrade my wallet to any smart account implementation?

While technically possible, most wallet developers are expected to heavily restrict which smart account implementations you can upgrade to, typically limiting options to:
- Their own implementation
- A very limited set of approved smart account implementations

This restriction exists because upgrading your account with EIP-7702 effectively requires the same level of trust as handling over your private key. As a result, when implementing EIP-7702 support, you will likely need to:

1. Prompt users to upgrade their EOA wallet (e.g., Metamask) to the specific 7702 implementation that their wallet allows
2. Work within the features available through that implementation

Note: Having users provide their private key would technically allow upgrading to any implementation but is a significant security risk and is not recommended.

## How can I test it out?

You can test out EIP-7702 with Pimlico's infrastructure on the Odyssey Testnet:

For a complete guide on how to test EIP-7702, check out our [step-by-step tutorial](/guides/eip7702/demo) which walks through the process of sending a sponsored userOperation from an EOA. You can also find a complete working example in our [7702 UserOp demo repository](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/7702-userop-demo).
