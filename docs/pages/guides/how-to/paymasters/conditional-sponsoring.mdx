# How to conditionally sponsor a user operation

With permissionless.js and Viem, you can conditionally sponsor a user operation. This can be useful in situations like:

- Sponsor only first 10 transactions
- Sponsor if they have a specific NFT

Let's take an example where you want to sponsor only the first 10 transactions.

:::::steps
### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the SimpleAccount.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/how-to/paymasters/conditional-sponsoring.ts:client]
```

### Create an account

Now, create an account. This can any of the accounts supported by permissionless.js or custom accounts conforming to the interface.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/how-to/paymasters/conditional-sponsoring.ts:account]
```

### Create the smart account client with the custom paymaster logic

We can sponsor a user operation conditionally by setting the paymaster field in sendTransaction only when the sponsorship conditions are met.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/how-to/paymasters/conditional-sponsoring.ts:smart-account-client]
```
