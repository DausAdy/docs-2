# Using Pimlico with Privy

This guide shows you how to enable Smart accounts on your Privy account powered by Pimlico's infrastructure.

## Why

Privy provides a seamless way to onboard users with embedded wallets and social logins. By enabling Smart accounts powered by Pimlico's infrastructure on Privy, you can:

- Sponsor gas fees to improve user experience
- Batch multiple transactions
- Use session keys for automations and uninterrupted confirmation
- Allow for additional recovery flows

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A Privy account with access to the dashboard
- Your app configured in Privy

## Configuration Steps

:::::steps
### Create an API key

[Create your API key](/guides/create-api-key) to access our infrastructure.

### Enable Smart Wallets in the Privy Dashboard
1. Navigate to your Privy Dashboard and locate the **Smart wallets** section in the left sidebar under **Wallet Infrastructure**.
2. Toggle on **Enable smart wallets for your app**. This allows users to log in with email, socials, passkey, or wallet and create a smart wallet for them.
3. Choose your preferred smart account implementation. Pimlico supports all types of smart accounts. For this guide, we'll use **Safe** as an example.

### Quick setup
You can either configure each chain manually or configure all chains in one go using **Quick setup**. We recommend using quick setup as it is easier and will enable Pimlico on all the chains.

### Configure Chains
1. Select Pimlico as the **Bundler and paymaster provider**.
2. Enter your Pimlico API key. You can [create an API key here](/guides/create-api-key).
3. Select the chains you want to configure. Pimlico supports all the chains on Privy (and more).

You can check the complete list of chains we support [here](/guides/supported-chains) and can reach out to us if you need help in supporting a chain that Privy doesn't support.

### Save Configuration
Click **Save and close** to apply your chain configuration, then click **Save changes** on the main Smart wallets page to persist all settings.
