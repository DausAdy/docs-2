# Using Pimlico with Privy

This guide shows you how to integrate Pimlico's infrastructure with Privy to enable smart wallets with gas sponsorship and enhanced functionality for your users.

### Overview

Privy provides a seamless way to onboard users with embedded wallets and social logins. By combining Privy with Pimlico's infrastructure, you can:

- Enable modular smart accounts for your users
- Sponsor gas fees to improve user experience
- Access advanced account abstraction features
- Support multiple EVM chains with reliable infrastructure

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A Privy account with access to the dashboard
- A Pimlico API key ([get one here](https://dashboard.pimlico.io))
- Your app configured in Privy

## Configuration Steps

:::::steps
### Enable Smart Wallets in Privy Dashboard
1. Navigate to your Privy Dashboard and locate the **Smart wallets** section in the left sidebar under **Wallet Infrastructure**.
2. Toggle on **Enable smart wallets for your app**. This allows users to log in with email, socials, passkey, or wallet and create a smart wallet for them.
3. Choose your preferred smart account implementation. Pimlico supports all types of smart accounts. For this guide, we'll use **Safe** as an example.

### Configure Chains
You can either configure each chain manually or configure all chains in one go using **Quick setup**. We recommend using quick setup as it is easier and will enable Pimlico on all the chains.

1. Select Pimlico as **Bundler and paymaster provider**.
2. Enter your Pimlico API key. You can get your API key from our [Dashboard](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys).
3. Select the chains you want to configure. Pimlico supports all the chains on Privy.

We support many more chains. You can check the complete list [here](/guides/supported-chains) and reach out to us if you need help in supporting a chain that Privy doesn't support.

### Save Configuration
Click **Save and close** to apply your chain configuration, then click **Save changes** on the main Smart wallets page to persist all settings.
