# How to claim a gas grant

This guide explains how to claim a gas grant that has been allocated to you through an organization like Arbitrum or Safe on Pimlico.

## Prerequisites

Before claiming your gas grant, ensure you have:
- A Pimlico Dashboard account, if not create one at [dashboard.pimlico.io](https://dashboard.pimlico.io)
- A valid claim link from the grant provider

## Claim the grant

::::steps

### Access the claim link
The grant provider e.g., a chain, protocol team, or hackathon organizer, will share a unique claim link with you. This link can only be claimed once, so handle it carefully.


### Log in to your Pimlico account
Before clicking the claim link, ensure you are logged in to your Pimlico Dashboard with the correct account. The grant will be permanently associated with the account that claims it.

### Choose the right account context
If you want to claim the grant for your organization rather than your personal account:

1. Check the bottom left of the sidebar to see which account is currently active
2. If you're in your personal account but want to claim for your organization, click on your account name to switch to your organization

:::info
Once claimed, the grant cannot be transferred between accounts, so make sure you're in the correct account context before proceeding.

### Click the claim link
After ensuring you're logged in with the correct account, click the claim link provided by the grant provider. You'll be redirected to a confirmation page showing:
- The grant amount allocated
- The sponsorship policy details
- Any usage restrictions or expiration dates


### Confirm the claim
Review the grant details and click "Claim Grant" to complete the process. You'll receive a confirmation that the grant has been successfully added to your account.

## Verify your claimed grant

To check that your grant has been successfully claimed and is active:

Navigate to the **Sponsorship Policies** page in your Pimlico Dashboard by clicking the link in the left sidebar or visiting [dashboard.pimlico.io/sponsorship-policies](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/sponsorship-policies)
Look for your newly claimed grant in the list of active policies.

:::tip
If you don't see your grant immediately after claiming, try refreshing the page. If it still doesn't appear, ensure you're viewing the correct account (personal vs. organization) that was used to claim the grant.
:::

## Common issues

### "Link already claimed" error
Each claim link can only be used once. If you see this error, the link has already been claimed by another account.

### "Invalid or expired link"
Some grants have expiration dates. Contact the grant provider if you believe you received an invalid link.

### Grant not showing in dashboard
Make sure you claimed the grant with the correct account (personal vs. organization). Grants are tied to the specific account that claimed them.
