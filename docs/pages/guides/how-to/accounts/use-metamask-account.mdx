# How to use MetaMask Smart Accounts with permissionless.js

:::info
MetaMask maintains their own in-house SDK built closely on top of viem that you can use for the account system while still plugging in all the other components from permissionless.js. Take a look at [their documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/delegation-toolkit/how-to/send-user-operation) for more information.
:::

The [MetaMask Delegation Toolkit](https://docs.metamask.io/delegation-toolkit/get-started/quickstart) is a collection of tools for creating MetaMask Smart Accounts. A smart account can delegate to another signer with granular permission sharing. It is built over [ERC-7710](https://eip.tools/eip/7710) and [ERC-7715](https://eip.tools/eip/7715) to support a standardized minimal interface. Requesting ERC-7715 permissions and redeeming ERC-7710 delegations are experimental features.

There are two types of accounts involved in delegation:

1. **Delegator account**: A smart account that supports programmable account behavior and advanced features such as multi-signature approvals, automated transaction batching, and custom security policies.
2. **Delegate account**: An account (smart account or EOA) that receives the delegation from the delegator account to perform actions on behalf of the delegator account.

You can use both accounts with permissionless.js.

## Installation

We will be using MetaMask's official SDK to create a smart account.

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm install permissionless viem @metamask/delegation-toolkit
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn add permissionless viem @metamask/delegation-toolkit
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm install permissionless viem @metamask/delegation-toolkit
```

```bash [bun]
bun install permissionless viem @metamask/delegation-toolkit
```

## Delegator Account

::::steps

### Create the clients

First we must create the public, (optionally) pimlico paymaster clients that will be used to interact with the MetaMask smart account.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:clients]
```

### Create the signer

MetaMask Smart Accounts can work with a variety of signing algorithms such as ECDSA, passkeys, and multisig.

For example, to create a signer based on a private key:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:signer]
```

### Create the delegator smart account

:::info
For a full list of options for creating a MetaMask smart account, take a look at the MetaMask's documentation page for [`toMetaMaskSmartAccount`](https://docs.metamask.io/delegation-toolkit/how-to/create-smart-account).
:::

With a signer, you can create a MetaMask smart account as such:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:smartAccount]
```

### Create the smart account client

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:smartAccountClient]
```

### Send a transaction

Transactions using permissionless.js simply wrap around user operations. This means you can switch to permissionless.js from your existing viem EOA codebase with minimal-to-no changes.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:submit]
```

This also means you can also use viem Contract instances to transact without any modifications.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:submitNft]
```

You can also send an array of transactions in a single batch.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:submitBatch]
```

## Delegate Account

A delegate account is an account that receives the delegation from the delegator account to perform actions on behalf of the delegator account.
To create a delegate account, we will follow the following steps:

1. Create a delegate signer
2. Create the delegate smart account
3. Create a delegation using delegator smart account
4. Sign the delegation
5. Send transactions using delegate smart account with signed delegation

:::

With a delegate signer, you can create a MetaMask delegate account as such:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:delegateSmartAccount]
```

### Create a delegation

This example passes an empty caveats array, which means the delegate can perform any action on the delegator's behalf. We recommend restricting the delegation by adding caveat enforcers.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:createDelegation]
```

### Sign the delegation

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:signDelegation]
```

### Create the smart account client

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:delegateSmartAccountClient]
```

### Send transactions using signed delegation

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/accounts/metamask.ts:sendTransactionWithDelegation]
```
