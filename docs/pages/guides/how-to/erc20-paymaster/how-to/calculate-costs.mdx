# How to calculate UserOperation's costs using the ERC-20 Paymaster

This guide will show you how to estimate your user operation's cost in denomination of the ERC-20 token as well as USD.

When using Pimlico's ERC-20 Paymaster, the `pimlico_getTokenQuotes` endpoint helps you calculate the cost of your userOperation. It returns values `exchangeRate` and `exchangeRateNativeToUsd`. These are useful for determining how much to approve upfront or for displaying the cost to your users.

## Steps

::::steps
### Define imports and create the clients

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/calculate-costs.ts:clients]
```

### Prepare the user operation

Prepare the user operation for the calls you want to make.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/calculate-costs.ts:prepareUserOperation]
```

### Calculate your userOperation's cost

To find the cost of your userOperation in denomination of the ERC-20 & USD, you should use pimlico client's `estimateErc20PaymasterCost` action.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/calculate-costs.ts:calculateCostInToken]
```

> Note: We divide `costInUsd` is always returned with 6 decimal places and you must format it before displaying it to the user wih `formatUnits(costInUsd, 6)`.
