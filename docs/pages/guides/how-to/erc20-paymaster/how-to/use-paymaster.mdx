# How to use the ERC-20 Paymaster

This guide will show you how to use the `prepareUserOperationForErc20Paymaster` function in permissionless.

This function lets you approve only the required amount of tokens for your userOperation. The approval call will be injected into the userOperation's calldata before it is sent.

## Steps

::::steps
### Define imports and create the clients

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/use-paymaster-without-unlimited-approval.ts:clients]
```

### Add the `prepareUserOperationForErc20Paymaster` override to `createSmartAccountClient`

This override will replace viem's `prepareUserOperation` action.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/use-paymaster-without-unlimited-approval.ts:prepareUserOperation]
```

By default, `prepareUserOperationForErc20Paymaster` does **not** override the user's ERC-20 token balance when estimating.  
If you want to estimate the operation without relying on the user's actual token balance (for example, when the user hasn't received tokens yet), you can pass the `balanceOverride` option as `true` like:

```ts
prepareUserOperation: prepareUserOperationForErc20Paymaster(pimlicoClient, { balanceOverride: true }),
```



### Call `sendTransaction`

Calling sendTransaction will now automatically approve the required amount of tokens for your userOperation.

If the sender has a sufficient existing approval, then the additional approval call will not be added to the calldata.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/erc20-paymaster/use-paymaster-without-unlimited-approval.ts:sendOp]
```
