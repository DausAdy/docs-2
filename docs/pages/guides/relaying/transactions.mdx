# Relay Transactions

Pimlico's transaction relaying service allows you to send transactions without managing private keys or dealing with gas management. With our relaying API, you can submit transactions that are guaranteed fast inclusion across over 100+ chains.

- Fast and guaranteed inclusion across 100+ chains
- You do not have to manage any private keys. Pimlico handles signing and submission
- Simplified gas management. No need to worry about gas price fluctuations
- High reliability with built-in retry mechanisms and monitoring

## How it Works

The relaying service exposes a standard wallet interface that accepts transaction calls and handles the complexity of getting them on-chain.

## Usage

Here's how to relay a transaction using Pimlico:

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/relaying/relay-transaction.ts:main]
```
