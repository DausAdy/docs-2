# Local Testing With BuildBear

This guide introduces how to setup a BuildBear Sandbox with for testing the Alto bundler and a mock paymaster. We will be using viem and permissionless to interact with the sandbox enviornment.

## Overview

BuildBear provides on-demand, isolated test environments that clone existing blockchain networks. These environments are perfect for testing account abstraction implementations as they:

- Provide a persistent, dedicated testnet environment
- Support EIP-4337 and all necessary AA infrastructure
- Allow you to fork from existing networks (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, etc.)
- Unlocked faucets for testing
- Offer an explorer interface for easy debugging

## Steps

### Creating and setting up a BuildBear Sandbox

1. Go to [buildbear.io](https://www.buildbear.io) and sign up for an account if you don't have one already.

2. Create a new Sandbox by clicking "Create a Sandbox" and selecting the network you want to fork (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Sepolia, etc.).

3. Navigate to the Plugin tab on your sandbox dashboard and install the Pimlico Plugin. Ensure the plugin appears as installed in the marketplace or Installed tab.

4. Go to your Buildbear sandbox dashboard and locate the RPC URL. Copy the RPC URL, which also serves as the Pimlico Client API endpoint. It should look something like the below.
    - BuildBear Sandbox RPC URL: `https://rpc.buildbear.io/<YOUR-SANDBOX-ID>`
    - Pimlico Client API: `https://rpc.buildbear.io/<YOUR-SANDBOX-ID>`

5. Once your Sandbox is created, you'll get access to:
   - RPC URL
   - Chain ID
   - Explorer URL
   - Faucet to fund your test accounts
