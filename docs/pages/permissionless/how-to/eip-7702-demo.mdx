# How to send a userOperation from a EOA using EIP-7702

This guide showcases a simple demo that uses ERC-4337 and EIP-7702 to send a sponsored userOperation from a EOA. We will use Safe as our smart account implementation of choice, but the same applies for any ERC-4337 compatible smart account.

For a high level overview of EIP-7702, checkout our [EIP-7702 conceptual guide](/conceptual/eip7702) and for a more technical overview, please refer to the [EIP-7702 proposal](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702).

## Steps

This guide is divided into two parts. The first part will walk you through how to turn your EOA into a ERC-4337 compatible smart account using EIP-7702. The second part will show you how to send a sponsored userOperation originating from your EOA.

## Part 1: Sending a EIP-7702 set code transaction

::::steps

### Setup

This demo will be ran on [Odyssey Testnet](https://www.ithaca.xyz/updates/odyssey), which already implements EIP-7702.

To get started, you can bridge funds from Sepolia to Odyssey through [Conduit's SuperBridge](https://odyssey-fba0638ec5f46615.testnets.rollbridge.app/).

You can confirm the bridge transfer by checking the [Odyssey blockchain explorer](https://odyssey-explorer.ithaca.xyz/).

### Confirming the EOA has no code

Before starting the demo, we can quickly confirm that our EOA has no code attached to it by running the following command:

```bash
cast code $YOUR_EOA_ADDRESS --rpc-url https://odyssey.ithaca.xyz
```

If should return back the following:

```bash
0x
```

### Signing the Authorization Request

We first need to prepare our EOA by signing a authorization request to set the Safe Singleton contract as our designated delegator. To do this, we extend our wallet client with [Viem's experimental EIP-7702 actions](https://viem.sh/experimental/eip7702).


```ts index.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/1_authorize.ts:authorization]
```

### Sending the Authorization Request

Before we can interact with our smart account, we also need to initialize it by populating it's storage. With Safe, this is done by calling the `setup` function.

We can make a slight optimization by sending both the Authorization and `setup` call in one transaction which would both set our EOA's code and setup our smart account.

:::info
Note: We are using a seperate private key, `safePrivateKey` instead of our EOA's private key to act as our smart account owner. This is because Safe currently doesn't allow the account owner to equal address(this).

:::code-group

```ts [index.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/1_authorize.ts:sendAuthorization]
```

```ts [setupData.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/setupData.ts]
```

```ts [safeAbi.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/safeAbi.ts]
```

:::

### Confirming the EOA has code

Now that the authorization request has been sent, we can confirm that our EOA has code attached to it by running the following command:

```bash
cast code $YOUR_EOA_ADDRESS --rpc-url https://odyssey.ithaca.xyz
```

If should return back the following:

```bash
0xef010041675c099f32341bf84bfc5382af534df5c7461a
```

Here the EOA's code is in the format of `(0xef0100 ++ address)` where `0xef0100` are magic bytes that indicate the EOA has a active delegation designator. The remaining bytes `0x41675c099f32341bf84bfc5382af534df5c7461a` is the Safe Singleton's address.

## Part 2: Sending the UserOperation

::::steps

### Preparing the clients

The setup process follows the typical flow of sending a userOperation. The only difference is that when creating the Safe smart account instance, we set the sender address as our EOA's address.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/2_sendUserOperation.ts:prepareClients]
```

### Sending the UserOperation

We can now send the userOperation as usual.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/7702/2_sendUserOperation.ts:sendUserOperation]
```

### Review

Congratulations! You have successfully sent a sponsored userOperation from your EOA, if you review the transaction on the blockchain explorer, you will see that the userOperation's sender address is equal to your EOA's address.

## Combined code

If you want to see the complete code that combines all of the previous steps, we uploaded it to a [separate repository](https://github.com/pimlicolabs/7702-demo). If you're looking to run it, remember to replace the API key with your own!
