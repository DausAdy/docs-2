# How to create and use a Coinbase smart account with permissionless.js


:::warning[Warning]
You should still use permissionless to fetch gas prices. As the bundler might not accept the prices fetched from viem. To learn how to use permissionless to fetch gas prices, [check out this guide](/permissionless/reference/pimlico-actions/getUserOperationGasPrice#getuseroperationgasprice).

Coinbase smart wallet accounts are supported natively by viem. We recommend using the native viem implementation for which the documentation [can be found here](https://viem.sh/account-abstraction/accounts/smart/toCoinbaseSmartAccount).
