# How to use a Turnkey signer with permissionless.js

[Turnkey](https://turnkey.com/) is a key infrastructure provider with a great developer API and a powerful security policy engine.

By combining permissionless.js with Turnkey, you can create **custodial AA wallets** whose security is provided by Turnkey, with powerful functionalities such as sponsoring gas, batching transactions, etc.

## Setup

To use Turnkey with permissionless.js, first create an application that integrates with Turnkey.

- Refer to the [Turnkey documentation site](https://docs.turnkey.com/) for instructions on setting up an application with the Turnkey.
- For a quick start, Turnkey provides examples, available [here](https://docs.turnkey.com/getting-started/examples).

## Integration
Integrating permissionless.js with Turnkey is straightforward after setting up the project. Turnkey provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with permissionless.js accounts.

### Create the TurnkeyClient and a Turnkey viem account
After following the Turnkey documentation, you will have access to a `TurnkeyClient`. An example is shown below that you can use to create a `SmartAccountSigner` object:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/v0_1/signers/turnkey.ts:main]
```

### Use with permissionless.js
