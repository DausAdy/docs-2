# How to use an Arcana Auth signer with permissionless.js

[Arcana Auth](https://www.arcana.network/) offers a self-custodial Web3 wallet embedded within applications, utilizing asynchronous distributed key generation algorithms for enhanced security and privacy. This wallet, accessible without the need for a browser extension, allows authenticated users to instantly access and sign blockchain transactions within the app environment.

## Setup

To use Arcana Auth with permissionless.js, first create an application that integrates with Arcana Auth.

- Refer to the [Arcana Auth documentation site](https://docs.arcana.network/) for instructions on setting up an application with the Arcana Auth.
- For a quick start, Arcana Auth provides a web app guide, available [here](https://docs.arcana.network/auth/sdk-installation/).

## Integration
Integrating permissionless.js with Arcana Auth is straightforward after setting up the project. Arcana Auth provides an Externally Owned Account (EOA) wallet to use as a signer with accounts created using permissionless.js.

### Create the authProvider object
After following the Arcana Auth documentation, you will have access to a `authProvider` object as shown below which you can use to create a `SmartAccountSigner` object:

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/v0_1/signers/arcana.ts:main]
```

### Use with permissionless.js

<SmartAccounts />
