# How to send multiple user operations in parallel

permissionless.js library lets you to send multiple transactions in parallel. This can be useful if you want to batch multiple calls in a single user operation or if you want to send user operations concurrently.

## Batching Multiple Calls

To batch multiple calls in a single user operation, you can use the `sendTransactions` method.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/v0_1/how-to/parallel-transactions.ts:multiple-transactions]
```

## Sending Multiple User Operations in Parallel

In an Externally Owned Account (EOA), the `nonce` is a simple incrementing number. However, in smart accounts, the `nonce` consists of two components: a `key` and a `sequence`:

- 192-bit “key”
- 64-bit “sequence”

For each unique `key`, the sequence must be incremented by 1 for each transaction. This means that if you send multiple transactions in parallel, you can use different `keys` for the parallel transactions.

### Parallel Transactions Ordering
Important thing to note is that parallel transaction's ordering is not guaranteed. So execution of random `key` on chain could be:

- [key-C][sequence-0]
- [key-A][sequence-0]
- [key-B][sequence-0]

While execution of `sequence` for a specific `key` will always be in order. So the following is a valid order of execution:
1. [key-C][sequence-0]
2. [key-A][sequence-0]
3. [key-C][sequence-1]
4. [key-B][sequence-0]
5. [key-A][sequence-1]
6. [key-B][sequence-1]


:::info
Note: Pimlico bundler currently only support up to 10 parallel transactions. If you need to send more than 10 transactions in parallel feel free to contact us at [support@pimlico.io](mailto:support@pimlico.io).
:::

In the example below, we use the current timestamp as the `key` to send parallel transactions. You can use any other value as the `key`.

```ts
// [!include ~/snippets/v0_1/how-to/parallel-transactions.ts:multiple-transactions-parallel]
```

This way, you can efficiently manage multiple transactions either sequentially or concurrently.
