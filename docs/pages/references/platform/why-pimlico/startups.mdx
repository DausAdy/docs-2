# Why Pimlico for Startups

Are you a startup looking to use smart accounts and wondering why you should use Pimlico as your account abstraction infrastructure provider?

Below are some reasons some of the best startup teams in crypto have chosen to build on Pimlico.

## Advanced Features

At Pimlico, we don't simply give you a bundler or paymaster URL. We are a full-fledged account abstraction infrastructure platform that provides a set of advanced tools to help you build with smart accounts.

This means you can expect features such as:
- Advanced [debugging tools](/infra/platform/debugging/dropped-user-operations), letting you automatically decode errors and simulate failed user operations
- Comprehensive monitoring and analytics, letting you see how many requests and user operations you're sending, how much you're spending on sponsorships, and more
- [Sponsorship policies](/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies), letting you set fine-grained conditions for which user operations you would like to sponsor, including global, per user, and per user operation spending limits, custom webhook validation, and more
- A [gas grants platform](/infra/platform/sponsorship-policies/gas-program), letting you apply for gas grants from our partners to help you get started with smart accounts without having to pay for gas
- Our permissionless and [audited](/infra/paymaster/erc20-paymaster/faqs#has-pimlicos-erc-20-paymaster-been-audited) [ERC-20 paymasters], letting your users pay with ERC-20 tokens like USDC for their transaction fees
- Multi-chain support, letting you build with smart accounts on [over 70+ chains](/infra/platform/supported-chains)
- API key authentication and authorization options, letting you control how your bundlers and paymasters can be accessed
- Flexible payment methods, letting you pay for your usage with a credit card, bank transfer, crypto
- [permissionless.js](/permissionless/why), a smart account-focused TypeScript library that supports any bundler and paymaster providers and all major smart account implementations, built by developers for developers with over 20,000 weekly NPM downloads.

## Pay-as-you-go pricing options

With Pimlico's pay-as-you-go plan, you can build with confidence knowing that you only pay for what you use. This means you can start building with smart accounts without having to commit to a long-term contract, and can scale your usage up or down as needed.

If you prefer a more predictable billing model, we can also offer [enterprise pricing plans](/infra/platform/why-pimlico/enterprise) that are tailored to your needs, with a discount on API credits and dedicated 1-1 support from our team.

## Lightning-fast integration times

We built Pimlico with a focus on smooth onboarding and lightning-fast integration times, making it as easy as possible for you to get started with smart accounts. The Pimlico platform is also selve-serve, so there is no need to wait for a sales call or a demo to get started.

We built our SDKs and APIs to be clean, modern, and well-typed, as well as having it be documentated comprehensively. This means you can expect to be up and running with smart accounts in a matter of hours, not weeks.
