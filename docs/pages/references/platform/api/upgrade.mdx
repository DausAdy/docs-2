# API Upgrade

We are announcing a change to our API behavior for the `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` method. Previously, our system provided a default ETH balance override when estimating gas for User Operations. This is an optional upgrade to make sure your users have enough ETH to cover the operation’s cost.

## What’s Changing?

### No More Default ETH Balance Override

After the change goes into effect, we will not add an ETH balance override by default when you call `eth_estimateUserOperationGas`.

### Possible AA21 Error

If a User Operation is not sponsored by a paymaster and the sender does not have enough ETH to cover the operation’s cost, you will encounter an AA21 error.

### If Users Have Sufficient Balance

If you already expect users to hold enough ETH for non-sponsored transactions, no changes are required on your end. You should be able to upgrade without any issues. Click [here](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys/upgrade) to upgrade.

## Estimating Without a User’s Balance

If you need to estimate a User Operation for a sender without sufficient balance, you can add state overrides to the `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` method.

#### Upgrade with permissionless

#### Upgrade to the raw API

You can use state overrides to simulate the user operation with a different
state the same way you would with
[`eth_call`](https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-eth#eth-call)
by including an optional third parameter. This is supported for both EntryPoint
v0.6 and v0.7.
