# Pagination

The Pimlico platform API supports certain “list” API methods. For example, you can list sponsorship policies. These list API methods share a common structure and accept, at a minimum, the following three parameters: `limit`, `starting_after`, and `ending_before`.

Pimlico's list API methods use cursor-based pagination through the `starting_after` and `ending_before` parameters. Both parameters accept an existing object ID value (see below) and return objects in reverse chronological order. The `ending_before` parameter returns objects listed before the named object. The `starting_after` parameter returns objects listed after the named object. These parameters are mutually exclusive. You can use either the starting_after or ending_before parameter, but not both simultaneously.

## Query Parameters

### limit

- **optional, default is 100**

This specifies a limit on the number of objects to return, ranging between 1 and 100.

### starting_after

- **optional object ID**

A cursor to use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include starting_after=obj_foo to fetch the next page of the list.

### ending_before

- **optional object ID**

A cursor to use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include ending_before=obj_bar to fetch the previous page of the list.
