# AA93 invalid paymasterAndData

:::info
The first 20 bytes of the `paymasterAndData` field specify the address of the paymaster contract you are requesting to use.
:::

The `paymasterAndData` field is of an incorrect length.

## Possible solutions

- Make sure you have either not set a value for the `paymasterAndData`, or that it is at least 20 bytes long.
- If you are using a paymaster provider like Pimlico, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).
