# AA51 prefund below actualGasCost

The actual gas cost of the user operation ended up being higher than the prefund paid by the smart account or the paymaster.

## Possible solutions

- If you encounter this error, try increasing the `verificationGasLimit` set for the user operation.
- If you are using the `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` or `pm_sponsorUserOperation` method from bundler provider like Pimlico to set user operation gas limits and the EntryPoint throws this error during submission, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).
- If all else fails, investigate why the actual gas cost ended up being higher than the prefund paid using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).
