# AA13 initCode failed or OOG

:::info
OOG = Out Of Gas
:::

The EntryPoint failed to create the smart account with the `initCode` provided. There are two possible reasons:
- The `initCode` ran out of gas
- The `initCode` reverted during the account deployment process

## Possible solutions

- Verify that the factory address in the `initCode` is correct (the factory address is the first 20 bytes of the `initCode`).
- Verify that the `initCode` is correct.
- Check whether the `verificationGasLimit` is sufficient for the `initCode` to complete without running out of gas.
- If the root cause is a revert, investigate why the `initCode` reverts during the account deployment process using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).
