# AA92 internal call only

The bundler attempted to call `innerHandleOp` function of the EntryPoint directly as opposed to through the `handleOps` function.

## Possible solutions

- If you encounter this error when running self-hosted bundler, make sure you have configured the bundler correctly.
- If you are using a bundler provider like Pimlico, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).
