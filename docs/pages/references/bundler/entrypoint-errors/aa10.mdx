# AA10 sender already constructed

The sender (i.e. the smart account) has already been created previously. You may be trying to create the account multiple times.

## Possible solutions

- Remove the `initCode` from the user operation.

```ts
const userOperationHash = await bundlerClient.sendUserOperation({
    initCode: "0xaee9762ce625e0a8f7b184670fb57c37bfe5e0a8f7...", // [!code --]
    initCode: "0x", // [!code ++]
    ..., // the rest of the user operation
})
```
