# AA41 too little verificationGas

The amount of gas used by the smart account verification exceeded the `verificationGasLimit` set for the user operation.

## Possible solutions

- Verify that the `verificationGasLimit` set for the user operation is high enough to cover the gas used during smart account's `validateUserOp` function.
- If you are using the `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` or `pm_sponsorUserOperation` method from bundler provider like Pimlico to set user operation gas limits and the EntryPoint throws this error during submission, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).
- If all else fails, investigate why the smart account's `validateUserOp` function used more gas than expected using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).
