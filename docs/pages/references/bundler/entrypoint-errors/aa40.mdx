# AA40 over verificationGasLimit

The amount of gas used by the smart account and paymaster verification exceeded the `verificationGasLimit` set for the user operation.

## Possible solutions

- Verify that the `verificationGasLimit` set for the user operation is high enough to cover the gas used during smart account and paymaster verification.
- If you are using the `eth_estimateUserOperationGas` or `pm_sponsorUserOperation` method from bundler provider like Pimlico to set user operation gas limits and the EntryPoint throws this error during submission, [reach out to them](https://t.me/pimlicoHQ).
- If all else fails, investigate why the smart account and/or paymaster used more gas than expected using tools like [Tenderly](https://tenderly.co/).
