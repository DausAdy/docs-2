# Bundler Error Codes

This page lists all bundler error codes as defined in [EIP-7769](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7769). These standardized error codes help developers identify and handle specific error conditions when interacting with ERC-4337 bundlers.

## Error Code Reference

### -32602: Invalid UserOperation

**Description:** Invalid `UserOperation` struct/fields

This error occurs when the UserOperation provided to the bundler contains invalid or malformed fields that don't meet the ERC-4337 specification requirements.

### -32500: EntryPoint Validation Failure

**Description:** Rejected by EntryPoint contract's `simulateValidation`

This error occurs during wallet creation or validation when the EntryPoint contract rejects the UserOperation. The error message will contain the specific "`AAxx`" error code from the EntryPoint.

### -32501: Paymaster Validation Failure

**Description:** Rejected by paymaster contract's `validatePaymasterUserOp`

This error occurs when the paymaster contract rejects the UserOperation during validation. The response will include:
- The paymaster's revert message
- A `paymaster` address in the data field

### -32502: Opcode Validation Violation

**Description:** Violation of ERC-7562 opcode validation rules

This error indicates that the UserOperation violates the opcode validation rules specified in ERC-7562, which define restrictions on certain opcodes for security and DoS prevention.

### -32503: UserOperation Out of Time Range

**Description:** UserOperation out of time-range

This error occurs when the wallet or paymaster validation time has expired. The response data includes:
- `validUntil`: The timestamp until which the operation was valid
- `validAfter`: The timestamp after which the operation becomes valid
- `paymaster` (optional): The paymaster address if applicable

### -32504: Paymaster Throttled or Banned

**Description:** Paymaster throttled or banned by ERC-7562 reputation rules

This error indicates that the paymaster has been throttled or banned according to the reputation rules defined in ERC-7562. The response must include the `paymaster` address.

### -32505: Insufficient Paymaster Stake

**Description:** Paymaster stake or unstake-delay too low

This error occurs when the paymaster doesn't meet the minimum stake or unstake delay requirements. The response includes:
- `paymaster`: The paymaster address
- `minimumStake`: The required minimum stake amount
- `minimumUnstakeDelay`: The required minimum unstake delay

### -32507: Wallet Signature Check Failed

**Description:** Wallet signature check failed

This error indicates that the signature validation for the UserOperation failed at the wallet level.

### -32508: Insufficient Paymaster Balance

**Description:** Paymaster balance insufficient for pending UserOperations

This error occurs when the paymaster doesn't have sufficient balance to cover the gas costs for all pending UserOperations that rely on it.

## Error Response Format

All error responses follow the JSON-RPC error format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "error": {
    "code": -32500,
    "message": "AA21 didn't pay prefund",
    "data": {
      // Additional error-specific data
    }
  }
}
```
