# How to use the bundler

:::tip[Tip]
We recommend using [permissionless.js](/references/permissionless/reference/smart-account-actions/sendUserOperation) as the SDK to interact with the bundler as it provides type-safe wrappers for all bundler methods.
:::

ERC-4337 bundlers are relayers that bundle user operations into transactions and submit them to the blockchain. You can interact with bundlers using standard JSON-RPC requests.

To get access to the bundler, you need to use your [Pimlico API key](https://dashboard.pimlico.io/apikeys). Using the API key, you can make the following JSON-RPC requests to the bundler:

- [eth_sendUserOperation](/references/bundler/endpoints/eth_sendUserOperation)
- [eth_estimateUserOperationGas](/references/bundler/endpoints/eth_estimateUserOperationGas)
- [eth_getUserOperationReceipt](/references/bundler/endpoints/eth_getUserOperationReceipt)
- [eth_getUserOperationByHash](/references/bundler/endpoints/eth_getUserOperationByHash)
- [eth_supportedEntryPoints](/references/bundler/endpoints/eth_supportedEntryPoints)
- [pimlico_getUserOperationGasPrice](/references/bundler/endpoints/pimlico_getUserOperationGasPrice)
- [pimlico_getUserOperationStatus](/references/bundler/endpoints/pimlico_getUserOperationStatus)

If you would like an end-to-end example of how to use the bundler, please refer to [tutorial 1](/references/permissionless/tutorial/tutorial-1) of the permissionless.js documentation.
