# How to use Alto in CI/CD testing

To effectively integrate Alto, a performant and type-safe ERC-4337 bundler developed by Pimlico, into your CI/CD testing pipeline, we recommend utilizing Prool, a library that provides programmatic HTTP testing instances for Ethereum.rool facilitates the creation of isolated Ethereum environments, enabling efficient testing of smart contracts and related components.
**Installation Steps:**

:::::steps

### Install Anvil
You can find detailed instructions in the [Anvil documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

Quickstart:
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Source the bashrc file:
::::code-group
```bash [bashrc]
source $HOME/.bashrc
```
```bash [zshrc]
source $HOME/.zshrc
```
::::

Install Foundry:
```bash
foundryup
```

### Install Prool and Alto:
   Use npm to install the Prool and Alto packages:

   ```bash
   npm install @pimlico/alto prool
   ```

  
### Set Up Prool with Anvil:

Prool offers pre-configured instances, including Anvil, which can be used to simulate a local Ethereum execution environment. By using the `fork` option, you can avoid deploying an entry point manually. If you opt for a bare-bones Anvil server, deploying the entry point yourself will be necessary.   

   ```ts
   import { createServer } from 'prool';
   import { anvil } from 'prool/instances';

   const anvilPort = 8545;

   const server = createServer({
     instance: anvil({
       port: anvilPort, // The port to run the Anvil server on
       forkUrl: 'https://mainnet.base.org',
       forkBlockNumber: 26008827, // This can be any block number
     }),
   });

   await server.start();
   ```
### Integrate Alto with Prool:

   Prool also provides an instance for Alto, enabling seamless integration into your testing environment.
   ```ts
   import { createServer } from 'prool';
   import { anvil, alto } from 'prool/instances';
   import { entryPoint06Address, entryPoint07Address } from "viem/account-abstraction"

   const anvilRpc = `http://localhost:${anvilPort}`
   const anvilPrivateKey =
        "0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80" // Choose any private key
    const altoPort = 4337

    const altoServer = createServer({
     instance: (key) =>
       alto({
         port: altoPort, // The port to run the Alto server on
         entrypoints: [entryPoint06Address, entryPoint07Address],
         rpcUrl: anvilRpc,
         executorPrivateKeys: [anvilPrivateKey],
       }),
   });

   await altoServer.start();
   ```

By following these steps, you can effectively incorporate Alto into your CI/CD testing pipeline using Prool, ensuring a robust and efficient testing environment for your Ethereum applications.
